<h3>Problem:</h3>
<p>Design a game using only coin flips with a probability of \(a/b\) of winning. This is a more general case
of the FiveThirtyEight <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-far-would-you-go-to-rig-a-coin-flip/">Riddler Express problem</a> which
asks you to design a game where the probability of winning is 1/3, 1/4, or 1/5.</p>
<h3>Solution:</h3>
<p>Use \(n\) coin flips to generate a random binary number \(m\) between 0 and \(2^n-1\), digit by digit
(heads can be 0 and tails 1, but it doesn't matter). Be sure to pick \(n\) such that \(b \leq 2^n\). If \(m\) is less than \(a\),
the game is won. If \(a \leq m \lt b\) the game is lost. If \(m \geq b\), restart the game. Continue generating
random numbers until the player either wins or loses.</p>

<h3>Formal Solution:</h3>
<p>Assume \(a, b \in \mathbb N \), \(a \leq b\) and \(a/b\) is in its most reduced form. Let \(n\) be the smallest integer such that \(b \le 2^n\).
The game proceeds as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Flip a coin \(n\) times, giving the sequence \((a_i)\) where \(a_i = 0\) if the \(i\)-th flip
  is heads or 1 if tails.</li>
  <li>Let \(m=\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \cdot 2^{i-1}\).</li>
  <li> If \(m \lt a\), WIN. If \(a \leq m \lt b\), LOSE. If \(m \geq b\), restart game at (1).</li>
</ol>
<h3>Analysis:</h3>
<p>Given that all sequences leading to \(m=0\) to \(m=2^n-1\) are equally likely, the probability of winning
a round is \(a/2^n\). The probability of losing a round is \((b-a)/2^n\). The probability of
having to restart after a round is \((2^n-b)/2^n\). Therefore the probability of winning the overall game is:
$$p = \frac{a}{2^n} \cdot 1 + \frac{b-a}{2^n} \cdot 0 + \frac{2^n-b}{2^n} \cdot p$$
$$p = \frac{a}{2^n} + p - \frac{b}{2^n}p$$
$$\frac{b}{2^n}p = \frac{a}{2^n}$$
$$p = \frac{a}{b}.$$
</p>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>A common way to generate a random number between 0 and \(b-1\) is to use modulo arithmetic. I.e.
mod(rand(), \(b\)). This will lead to some values having higher probability of appearing unless the number of unique
values from the random number generator is perfectly divisible by \(b\). This is why restarting is required in this game.
To keep restarts to a minimum, pick the number of coin flips to be the smallest possible such that \(b \leq 2^n\).
